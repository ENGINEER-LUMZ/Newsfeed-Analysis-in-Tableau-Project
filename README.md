"# Newsfeed-Analysis-in-Tableau-Project" 

The above dashboard includes the following:

1) A dual chart with a bar chart that displays the monthly count of posts and relevant average likes per post. This graph provides insights into the content's popularity. It helps analyze whether posts with higher likes are concentrated within specific months, assists in identifying trends in user engagement, and enables discovering seasonality in student engagement activity.

2) Three horizontal bar charts that rank the following post subtypes:

The first chart shows the overall number of posts per subtype.

The second chart ranks comments generated by each subtype.

The third chart ranks likes generated by each subtype.

These three charts provide a breakdown of which subtypes receive the most posts, likes, and commentsâ€”enabling analysis of the most impactful content types and understanding user preferences and engagement trends.

3) A horizontal bar chart that illustrates user activity on the newsfeed, indicating the number of users who visited the newsfeed, the number of active users, and the active users who engaged through likes, comments, or manual posts. The visualization will reveal the proportion of users actively engaging with the newsfeed. By simultaneously showing the number of visitors and the active participants, this graph demonstrates the level of user interaction within the newsfeed.

The dashboard includes two primary filters:

A time range filter enabling focused observation within specific periods of interest
A post subtype filter offering the choice to view and explore types of posts
